# Stock Analysis Code Refacture

## Overview of Project
I have built a program that helps Steve compare different stocks' performace for 2017 and 2018 in order to help his parents. Once the original code was built and ran successfully, I worked on refacturing the code so that Steve can analyze a larger dataset if he wants, while making sure the code does not take longer to run than the original AllStocksAnalysis code. For this project, the goal is to see if refactoring the code improves its performance. The performance of the code will be measured by how long the program takes to run from start to finish. Then, the performance will be compared with that of the previous code, *AllStocksAnalysis.*
