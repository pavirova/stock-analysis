# Stock Analysis Code Refactored

## Overview of Project
I have built a program that helps Steve compare different stocks' performace for 2017 and 2018 in order to help his parents. Once the original code was built and ran successfully, I worked on refacturing the code so that Steve can analyze a larger dataset if he wants, while making sure the code does not take longer to run than the original AllStocksAnalysis code. For this project, the goal is to see if refactoring the code improves its performance. The performance of the code will be measured by how long the program takes to run from start to finish. Then, the performance will be compared with that of the previous code, *AllStocksAnalysis.*

## Results
When running the code for years 2017 and 2018, we can see how the different stocks performed by looking at the return column on the "All Stocks Analysis" worksheet. For the year 2017, all of the stocks' performance improved except for the "TERP" stock. In 2017, the "TERP" stock's returns decreased by 7.2%, while in 2018, the "TERP" stock performance decreased by 5%. In 2018, we can see that the performance for 9 more stocks decreased from the beginning of 2018 to end of 2018, putting these stocks' returns as negative.



## Summary
Refactoring code has its advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages of refactoring code are that it forces you to look at different ways to improve how a problem is solved. Refactoring can help make a code more efficient, improving the code's overall performance by, for example, running faster or using less memory. Additionally, refactoring code can help other users are well as yourself understand the code more clearly. Some disadvantages of refactoring code are that one might be faced with additional errors that they were not facing in the original code. In addition to the errors one could come across, refactoring code can also be time consuming depending on how complex the code is.
